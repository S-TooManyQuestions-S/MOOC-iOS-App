# MOOC-iOS-App
>Where self-education begins..

## Introduction
My first project as a first-year student of the FCS HSE. Project contains two parts: 
* Server (Deployed on Linux, Unbuntu 18.04)
* Client (Xamarin.IOS project)

The connection between server and client is implemented via .Net Core Web Api. Server is rented on the [platform](ruvds.com) until 26.05.2020
